The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. This was by the very succesful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface).
